# How to use the methods
### IMPORTANT: this is only for this stage of the project, later is going to be in our page. Some of the rules may be the same

All the functions have to be written with the follwing rules:

* All the terms have to be correctly separated. Ex. 3x-sec(6x) --> 3*x-sec(6*x)
* Fot e^(x) has to be written as e(x). Ex: e^(4x-5x) --> e(4*x-5*x)
